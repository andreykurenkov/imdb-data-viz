  This chart visualizes the number of movies genre releases from 1915 to 2014, as either
  their absolute counts or percentage of releases. The data is gotten from IMDB   
  with <a href="https://github.com/andreykurenkov/data-movies">this code</a>, and then       
  further post-processed with D3 and visualized with dimple.js. These are total counts of genre tags rather  
  than movies, since a single movie may tagged as both a Comedy and Romance,      
  and some filtering is done to avoid counting incredibely obscure movies by not  
  counting movies with less than  10 IMDB user votes. The visualization conveys an
  intentionally broad story about the relative popularity of genres and movies    
  overall over the last 90 years, with various interesting patterns such as the   
  rise of the documentary starting from the 60s and the decrease of the popularity
  of action movies past the 80s.<hr>

  Need to collect feedback, some questions:<br>
  What do you notice in the visualization?<br>
  What questions do you have about the data?<br>
  What relationships do you notice?<br>
  What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?<br>
  Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?<br>
