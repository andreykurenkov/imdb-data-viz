        This chart visualizes the number of genre movie releases between 1915 and 2013, as either
        their absolute counts or percentage of releases, as well as the total number of movies in those years.
        The clear conclusion from this visualization is that there has been an explosion in film
        production from the 90s onward, and beyond that there are a multitude of possible smaller
        conclusions regarding the relative popularity of genres and movies overall.
        <br><br>
        Based on data from IMDB collected with <a href="https://github.com/andreykurenkov/data-movies">this code</a>.
        A single movie may be associated with zero, one, or multiple genres. The 'Total Movies' line corresponds to actual
        movie counts, and every colored-in area represents the number of movies tagged with that genre for that year.
        The legend is interactive, so both the 'Total Movies' and genre rectangles can be clicked to toggle display
        of that data. The cutoff years are chosen due to there being very few movies comparable to modern films prior
        to 1915, and the data seemingly being incomplete post 2013.
